OAM-RaumController
===

Implementation of an knx application, which combines some [OpenKNX-Projects](https://github.com/OpenKNX) to provide an ETS programmable device. It allows a parametrization via ETS in general, this project requires ETS 5.7 or higher.

It is a PlatformIO project and needs a working ETS 5.7 (or higher) installed on the same PC.

It uses some Modules from the OpenKNX project to implement a device, which can automate a Room in a House.

For more information look into our [OpenKNX-wiki](https://github.com/OpenKNX/OpenKNX/wiki).

Reference for other OAMs

This project doubles as the worked example for enabling the FTC file-transfer client (remote console and
delta firmware update over the KNX bus) in an OAM: which build switches, how the ETS parameters are
injected into the Common "Erweitert" page, which module branches are required, and what the release chain
does and does not build.
